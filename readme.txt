== Description ==
This plugin enhances ShareThis social share buttons by allowing you to multiply the share count visually on the frontend and display it in a more impactful format like **1.5k** or **2M**.

It's great for publishers, marketers, and bloggers who want to display rounded, eye-catching numbers based on ShareThis' share counts.
